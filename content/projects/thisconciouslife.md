After a WordPress update the entire websiteâ€™s content simply disappeared. My job was to restore all the content. After investigating and hoping not to repopulate everything, it turns out the ACF fields were reset in the WordPress backend. I restored everything by recreating all the ACF fields based on the exact names used in theme files. Thus, reconnecting all the data stored in these fields originally.
