Minicaso is a sleek online store built with WordPress and the WooCommerce plugin. The client insisted on having a very minimal look that only displayed the necessities. Thus, I stuck with a professional black and white theme with the occasional splash of blue. Also, I used the Roots sage starter theme to reduce the development time, so I could focus more on optimisation.
