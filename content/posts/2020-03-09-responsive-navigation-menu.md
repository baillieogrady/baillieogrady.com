In this video I demonstrate how to code the default responsive navigation menu I use for 80% of my website builds, using only HTML, CSS & JavaScript. The navigation consists of just one menu for both desktop and mobile. To achieve this I simply restyled it for mobile and added some really simple JavaScript to toggle the menu via a hamburger icon.
