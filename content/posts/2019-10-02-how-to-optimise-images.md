Selecting colors can be a daunting task, even for a practise project, them colors need to be on point! Through my journey of becoming a web developer I’ve discovered many useful websites that alleviate this task…

## The List…

1.  [Flatuicolors](https://flatuicolors.com/) – A great selection of flat color palettes, definitely a choice for the minimalistic of you.
2.  [Colormind](http://colormind.io/) – Allows you to generate a random color palette.
3.  [Flatuicolorpicker](http://www.flatuicolorpicker.com/) – Yet another flat color palette collection, many more compared to [Flatuicolors](https://flatuicolors.com/).
4.  [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) – Similar to colormind but some favour this one for its simplicity and accessibility testing.
5.  [Colorhexa](https://www.colorhexa.com/)– More a color decider than picker, provides a comprehensive look into your color choice. Presenting complementary colors, alternatives, accessibility analysis and much more.
