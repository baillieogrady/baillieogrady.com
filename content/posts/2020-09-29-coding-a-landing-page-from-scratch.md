Below is a mini series of youtube videos I created, converting landing page web designs to code. I use basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Landings

First in the series of coding landing pages from scratch is this minimal, sleek and modern looking landing page. I initially discovered the design on Hannah Milan's dribble (link below) where she offered a free Adobe XD landing page download link. I coded the landing page utilising a mobile first approach ensuring it was fully responsive. Interactive elements include the minimal overlay menu using pure vanilla JavaScript, a video modal by incorporating the GLightbox library, on scroll animations via AOS and lazy loading images using LazyLoad by Verlok.

Simple and clean landing page concept , suitable for anyone wanting to showcase their photos. I coded the landing page with a mobile first approach ensuring it was fully responsive. Interactive elements include a minimal overlay menu using pure vanilla JavaScript, CSS animations and a slider using slick.js.
