Cloudbudget-gulp is an open source WordPress theme I created by converting a free Figma template provided by [Mohammed Ali](https://dribbble.com/ScratchCoders). I loved it's simplcity and thought many startup businesses or those looking for a minimal online presence would find it helpful for their initial website design.

What's more, I decided to build this theme with an old starter theme I used a few years back. I just wanted to get some perspetive on how much easier and quicker [Roots Sage](https://roots.io/sage/) actually is in comparison. In conclusion, Roots Sage's acf/builder composer package alone saves an enormous amount of time. Instead of taking me 2 days to build with the old theme, I predict I could've completed it in 1 with Roots Sage.

It may not seem like a huge difference 1 day an all, but if you consider this same ratio for a 2 week project, that's 7 days saved.
