[Captain's cotton](https://instagram.com/captainscotton) is a e-commerce website that sells handcrafted dog bandanas. They craft the bandanas from a variety of patterned fabrics, with each bandana being available in 4 different sizes. Major credit to [Natalie Potts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natalie-potts-07b99b110/) for designing the logo.

This project was unique in that I designed and developed the whole website, building everything in just 2 days. It took only one short day to gather the current branding and digital assets and plug them into a nice, minimal e-commere experience. Leaving just one day to convert the web designs to a WooCommerce WordPress theme.

I used the open source [EXO](https://dribbble.com/shots/11967273-EXO-KIT-Design-System) UI kit by the talented [Anthony Choren](https://dribbble.com/AnthonyChoren) to achieve a great looking UI in very limited time. Specifically, I used the footer and card components from his UI kit and altered the colours to match Captain's Cotton's branding.
