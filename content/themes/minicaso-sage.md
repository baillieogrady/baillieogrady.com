Minicaso is a e-commerce website that specialises in selling AirPods cases. They wanted a miminal website that has a simple and intuitive UX. Moreover, they did'nt have any intial designs so I designed and developed the whole website within 3 weeks.

The themes contains miminal UI elements including a hero, two column layout and a product carousel. For simplicity I use slick.js for the carousel as it's really easy to manipulate the carousel and alter the styles to match your designs.

What's more, for the product page I realy liked the idea of 'sticking' the product gallery whilst the user scroll through the product information. Thsi was easily accomplished using the CSS 'sticky' property. Example [here](http://minicaso.com/shop/hooded/hooded-airpods-case-white/).
