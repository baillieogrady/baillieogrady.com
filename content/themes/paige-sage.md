Paige wanted a simple landing page to showcase her passion for writing. I built her a minimal WordPress theme inspired by [kathrynmcclintock](http://www.kathrynmcclintock.com/)'s portfolio website.

It features a simple but elegant landing page with a domino like design, featured image on the left and infromation on the right. The main purpose behind this theme was to create something simple that is easily extendable. As it's built with gutenberg in mind, you can simply add blocks to the information on the right.

Moreover, as the user scrolls and if the information becomes scrollable, the image on the left remains fixed.w
